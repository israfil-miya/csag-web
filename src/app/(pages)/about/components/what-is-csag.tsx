            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
              Founded in 2005, CSAG began as a small community initiative in
              rural Ghana. What started as a simple mission to provide basic
              educational resources to underprivileged children has grown into a
              comprehensive organization that has impacted hundreds of thousands
              of lives across the country.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
              We believe that every child, regardless of their background or
              circumstances, deserves access to quality education. Our work
              focuses on rural communities where educational opportunities are
              limited, and where the cycle of poverty is most entrenched.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
              Through innovative programs, community partnerships, and the
              dedication of our team and volunteers, we're creating lasting
              change in communities across Ghana. We're not just building
              schools â€“ we're building futures.
