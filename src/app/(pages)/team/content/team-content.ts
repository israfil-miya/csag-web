      "Children cannot choose their birth circumstances, but they can shape their future. In many parts of the world, poverty denies them this chance. Without education, they remain trapped in a cycle where their families cannot afford schooling, forcing them into low-paying labor, which continues the cycle for the next generation. Education is the key to breaking this loop. It empowers children to challenge inequality, escape exploitation, and build a better future. As a student, I understand its value and am committed to helping more people recognize the urgent need for educational support. Together, we can make a difference.",

Living alongside the local community and interacting with them helped me understand the richness and uniqueness of this nation. I was genuinely touched by their warmth and hospitality. The biggest reward for me was being able to relate to people from another country, sharing stories and creating lasting memories. This experience has changed my perspective and inspired me in so many ways.",
